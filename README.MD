** This is a summary of what I have learnt during this project so far.**

## Text Processing:
Learnt about regular expressions as  tools  used for pattern matching and text manipulation. 
They provide a concise and flexible way to search, extract, and manipulate text from  large data based on specific criteria. 
</br>
Explored nltk and spacy for tokenizing text at sentence, word or character level.
Further, understood imoportance of normalization of text for NLP tasks. Normalization includes steps to  
removing stopwords, stemming , lemmatization, accent removal, case normalization and other steps to make text simpler.

</br>
implementing POS tagging using nltk and spacy.
Creating a wordcloud of compliments to a restaurant using its review data.
</br>

**Converting text to a form that machines can understand (vectors)**
Understood the working of count vectorization as well as TFIDF vectorization by manually making a term-document and term-frequency-document matrix.
Implemented count_vectorizer and TFIDF vecotrizer from sklearn.

***Working principle and importance of Naive Bayes classifier for making predictions based on conditional probabilities***
